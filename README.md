### Commandline:

    Once everything is up and running, start developing! DON’T forget to commit frequently on your personal fork. If you are not familiar with git, read prerequisite above about git.

### Understanding Vue:
    Knowing the basics of JavaScript
    Vue basics (components, props, class/style binding)
    Vue router to add functionality
    Overview of how vueX  works (comparable to Redux)
    Bootstrap4, particularly containers/components

### Developer Procedure:
    Learn basic HTML,CSS, Javascript, and git:
    Lynda.com, codecademy, hackerrank
    Setup dev environment
    Check on github if there is any issue that are assigned to you.
    Pull request from the upstream and commit.
    Work on the issue that are assigned. If there aren’t any, assign some issues that you want to work on to yourself.
    Push request after working on the issue to YOUR repository!!! Not upstream!
    Once your repo is ready to merge with the upstream. Talk with team manager and get it confirmed.
    Repeat 3~7.
